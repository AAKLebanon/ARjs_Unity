# Unity tool for AR.js
This tool is in it's early stages, but is meant to help the user to build an AR.js project using Unity to help make the 3D object placement a breeze. This project is by no means complete, and currently only supports adding basic shapes to the scene, changing the shapes' colors or textures, simple linear animations, and the ability to click an object to trigger an animation or open a webpage.

##Setup
Drop the folder titled "ARjs_Unity" into the Assets folder within your Unity project. Currently, the name and placement of the folder is important, or else it won't work. After this has been added to your project, download the [AR.js project from GitHub](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js). Take the "AR.js-master" folder and drop that into the Assets folder as well. Again, name and placement of the folder matters.
